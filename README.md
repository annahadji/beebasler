# üé• üêù BeeBasler

Personal setup of recording honeybees using Basler's pypylon library. Used for orchestrating filming as well as previewing frames
from the camera as requested on localhost:8000.

## Getting started

Clone the repo, install the dependencies and run using `python3 record.py`. Whilst filming, you can
navigate to https://localhost:8000 and refresh to preview a current frame from camera.

There are a few parameters used to configure filming:
